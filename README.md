# SpongeOnRails - A Mod bringing compatibility between the Railcraft Mod and the Sponge API.

Here you will find the source and issue tracker for **SpongeOnRails**.
SpongeOnRails is not affliated with SpongeAPI; its cause is supported by CovertJaguar, for it may improve the playability
of Railcraft and user experiences.

## What is Railcraft?

Railcraft is a mod written for the hit game [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/). It is built on top of the [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge) API.

It greatly expands and improves the Minecart system in Minecraft. Adding many new blocks, entities, and features. It has been in development since 2012 and contains over 800 class files and hundreds of thousands of lines of code.

The mod was created and is still currently maintained by the user going by the name **CovertJaguar**.

## What is Sponge API?

Go to Sponge API's official repo here: https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeAPI#spongeapi-

## Why does this repository exist?

Once, Github user @gabizou made a project called [ThaumicSponge](https://github.com/gabizou/ThaumicSponge). This becomes the
primary motivation to make a similar project to provide plugins with abilities to integrate with mods. The expected use cases
are use of mod moving sounds, particles, jobs plugins that work with players' uses of machines, etc. They are not supposed to impose
limits on Railcraft but to increase the playability of it.

The name of the repository is suggested by liach and kashike.
